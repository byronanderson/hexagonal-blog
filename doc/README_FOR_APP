In this application, I want to play with the object-oriented approach that Matt Wynne describes as "Hexagonal Rails"
(See http://blog.mattwynne.net/category/hexagonal-rails/)

I want to have this application:
- authenticate only to me,
- allow me to make blog posts,
- allow others to see my blog posts,
- tweet when I publish a new blog post like "New blog post: #{blog_post.title} #{hyperlink}"
